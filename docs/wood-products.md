## Summary from GenAI

## Hard Maple

"Hard" maple refers to a type of maple wood known for its density, durability, and hardness. The term "hard maple" is commonly used to describe two specific species of maple trees:

1. **Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum):** Also known as rock maple, this is the most commonly referenced species when people talk about "hard maple." It is prized for its strength, resistance to abrasion, and beautiful fine-grained appearance. Sugar maple is widely used in flooring, furniture, cabinetry, and for making musical instruments, as well as sports equipment like bowling pins and baseball bats.

2. **Black Maple (Acer nigrum):** This species is closely related to sugar maple and shares many of its properties. It is also considered "hard" maple, though it is slightly less common.

The key characteristics that distinguish "hard" maple from "soft" maple (which includes species like red maple, silver maple, and bigleaf maple) are its greater density, hardness, and durability. "Hard" maple is also known for its light color, usually a pale cream to light brown, often with subtle variations and sometimes with a reddish tinge. It is a popular choice for high-traffic areas and applications where a durable, long-lasting material is needed.

## Hickory

Hickory wood is valued for its strength, hardness, and shock resistance, making it a popular choice for a variety of wood products. Several species of hickory trees are commonly used in the production of wood products:

1. **Shagbark Hickory (Carya ovata)**
   - **Description:** Known for its distinctive shaggy bark that peels off in long strips, shagbark hickory is one of the most commonly used hickories for wood products.
   - **Uses:** Flooring, tool handles, furniture, cabinetry, and firewood. Shagbark hickory is also prized for smoking meats.

2. **Shellbark Hickory (Carya laciniosa)**
   - **Description:** Also known as kingnut hickory, shellbark has thicker nuts and larger leaves compared to shagbark. Its bark is similar but often less shaggy.
   - **Uses:** Similar to shagbark hickory, it is used for tool handles, flooring, furniture, and firewood.

3. **Pignut Hickory (Carya glabra)**
   - **Description:** This hickory species has smoother bark compared to shagbark and shellbark, with nuts that are often bitter, hence the name "pignut."
   - **Uses:** Tool handles, furniture, and flooring. Pignut hickory is also used for smoking meats and as firewood.

4. **Mockernut Hickory (Carya tomentosa)**
   - **Description:** Mockernut hickory has a thick, hard shell around its nuts and leaves with a downy underside. Its bark is furrowed but less shaggy than shagbark.
   - **Uses:** Similar to other hickories, it is used in the production of tool handles, flooring, furniture, and firewood.

5. **Bitternut Hickory (Carya cordiformis)**
   - **Description:** Known for its bright yellow buds and bitter nuts, bitternut hickory is less common in woodworking but still valued for its strong, tough wood.
   - **Uses:** Primarily used in tool handles and firewood. It is less commonly used in furniture and flooring due to its bitter-tasting nuts and slightly lower workability.

6. **Pecan Hickory (Carya illinoinensis)**
   - **Description:** While better known for its edible nuts (pecans), the wood of the pecan tree is also a type of hickory and shares many of the same properties as other hickories.
   - **Uses:** Furniture, cabinetry, and flooring. Pecan wood is also popular for smoking meats.

### Summary of Uses
Hickory wood, across its various species, is primarily used for:
- **Tool handles** due to its high shock resistance.
